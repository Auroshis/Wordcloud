# WordCloud!

Hi There! I made this for kind of a fun project and part of my python course on coursera offered by Google. Basically, this script takes input any **.txt** file , removes punctuation, numbers(optional), unnecessary words like auxiliary verbs, prepositions and many more mentioned in the code.
The output of the project will look like this

I have attached both the **.py** and **.ipynb** in this repository.
All the dependencies will install automatically on running the script.


**Steps to use  the  script in Jupyter notebook or any python notebook:-**

 - Open the **.ipynb** file in your **Python notebook**.
 - Run the first cell to install the dependencies.
 - Run the second cell and it will give you an **Browse** button just below the cell. Browse your **.txt** file and upload it.
 - Run the remaining cells in your python notebook. The *WordCloud* image generated
will be in the output of the last cell.

**List of dependencies**

 - WordCloud
 - Numpy
 - fileupload
 - ipywidgets
 - matplotlib
 
 **New Features to be added**
 

 - Incorporating wordcloud within an webapp.
 - Adding user-desired background image instead of black background.
 
 *Happy WordClouding*
